# Discord Clone

## Introduction
Welcome to the Discord Clone project! This project aims to replicate the popular Discord application, leveraging the latest frontend tools to provide a seamless user experience. By using cutting-edge technologies such as Next.js, Zustand for state management, React Query for efficient data fetching, Prisma as our SQL ORM, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Socket.IO for real-time data updates, we strive to create a dynamic and responsive platform for communication and collaboration.

## Getting Started

**Set Up Environment Variables**: Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables:

```.env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/
DATABASE_URL=
UPLOADTHING_SECRET=
UPLOADTHING_APP_ID=
